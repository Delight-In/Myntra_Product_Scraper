When conducting **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and performing **Feature Engineering**, the goal is to understand the underlying structure of the data, detect patterns, identify relationships, spot outliers, and prepare the data for machine learning models. While the exact steps and features to explore depend on the data type (e.g., text, image, time series, etc.), there are common approaches and general features you should focus on during EDA and feature engineering across various types of data.

### General Steps for EDA and Feature Engineering:

#### **1. Understanding the Data Distribution**:
   - **Statistical Summary**: For numeric features, check the **mean**, **median**, **variance**, **standard deviation**, **skewness**, **kurtosis**, **min**, and **max**. This helps you identify outliers, understand the spread, and see if the data is normally distributed.

   - **Missing Values**: Identify the percentage of missing values in each feature. Decide whether to impute, remove, or handle missing values differently based on their significance.
   - **Correlations**: For numerical features, look at the **correlation matrix** to check for multicollinearity between features. For categorical data, check the **chi-square** test for independence.
